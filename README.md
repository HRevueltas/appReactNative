- Immediate light control ‚ö°
- Basic scheduling system üïí
- Activity logging üìù
- Real-time status updates üîÑ

## Features
(Developed in Priority Order)

1. **Core Functions** (Week 1)
   - Manual light control
   - Basic section management
   - Simple on/off scheduling

2. **Enhanced Features** (Week 2)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HRevueltas/appReactNative.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd appReactNative
npm install
```

3. Important: Configure ESP32 IP Address

The app requires proper configuration of the ESP32 server IP address. By default it uses http://192.168.194.93.
You must update this IP address to match your ESP32's IP in these files:
 - `components/ControlPanel.js`
 - `components/Scheduler.js`
 - `components/FixedScheduleScheduler.js`

4. Start the app:
```bash
npm start
```
